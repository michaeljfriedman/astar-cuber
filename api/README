This is the framework for a single-page application API viewer. It allows a
developer to write up APIs in JSON and view them in a nice format in a web browser.


The framework requires the following from the developer:

1) 	All JSON files go in the json/ sub-directory

2) 	Write a file json/objects.json that contains a list of all objects for which
	you would like to view the written API. The name of each object in this list
	must be the same as the file name for its API (i.e. object "Animal" has its API
	in "Animal.json").

3) 	APIs written in JSON must adhere to the format read by the application. See the
	sample files inthe json/ sub-directory to see this format.
