	"description": "DistanceHeuristic is an interface for an object that defines a measure of how close a cube is to being solved. In more mathematical terms, it defines a distance function f, which computes the distance from any cube C to the solved cube S. It must satisfy the properties that (1) f(S) = 0 and (2) [ limit of f(C) as C -> S ] = 0. (Note that, in property (2) what it means for C to 'approach' S depends on the distance function itself.)",
